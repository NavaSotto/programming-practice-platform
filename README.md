# Trivia game

I developed a trivia game for the whole family with the goal of conveying the closures during the Corona period in a more pleasant and fun way
The questions are sent by the user in an Excel format that can be downloaded from the landing page
Then the game goes down to the computer and requires the entry of details and payment
Gameplay: Combined questions are displayed in photos and videos and users have to choose the answer one after the other
Of course there will be competition by presenting those winners who answered the correct answers the fastest
The game can be played over and over again (the registry keeps the game details on the computer and only when building a new game does it require additional payment)
